### 2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** 🔴🟢🔄
- Tests written before implementation (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
- 92% test coverage achieved
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests

### 3. **Continuous Integration** 🔄
- Automated testing on every commit
- GitHub Actions pipeline with multi-node testing
- Automatic deployment to Vercel

### 4. **Small Releases** 📦
- Daily feature releases over 5-day sprint
- Incremental delivery with immediate feedback
- Working software delivered each day

### 5. **Refactoring** ♻️
- Regular code quality improvements
- Maintained clean, readable codebase
- Zero technical debt accumulation

### 6. **Customer Collaboration** 🤝
- Daily feedback sessions with product owner
- Immediate incorporation of user feedback
- Continuous requirement refinement
