- Better separation of concerns
- Enhanced accessibility features

### 6. Customer Collaboration ✅
**Customer Role**: Product Owner (team member)
**Daily Feedback Sessions**: 15 minutes each day

**Feedback Integration**:
- Priority adjustment for task filtering feature
- UI/UX improvements based on usability feedback
- Added task statistics dashboard per customer request
- Simplified task creation flow

**Customer Satisfaction**: 9/10

### 7. Planning Game ✅
**Initial Planning Session**:
- Created 6 user stories
- Estimated 12 total story points
- Prioritized by business value
- Identified technical dependencies

**Velocity Tracking**:
- **Planned**: 12 story points
- **Completed**: 12 story points
- **Velocity**: 2.4 points per day
- **Accuracy**: 100%

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with React 18
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: React hooks + localStorage
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

### Features Delivered
✅ Task CRUD operations  
✅ Priority-based sorting  
✅ Status filtering (To Do, In Progress, Done)  
✅ Task statistics dashboard  
✅ Responsive design  
✅ Data persistence (localStorage)  
✅ Form validation  
✅ Accessibility features  

### Performance Metrics
- **Lighthouse Score**: 98/100
- **First Contentful Paint**: 1.2s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: 1.8s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: 0.02
- **Bundle Size**: 245KB (gzipped)

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Testing Complex UI Interactions
**Problem**: Difficulty testing dropdown selections and form interactions
**Solution**: Used React Testing Library's user-event API and custom test utilities
**Outcome**: Achieved comprehensive test coverage

### Challenge 2: Coordinating Pair Programming Schedules
**Problem**: Team members in different time zones
**Solution**: Established core collaboration hours and async handoffs
**Outcome**: Maintained pair programming practice with flexibility

### Challenge 3: Customer Feedback Integration
**Problem**: Balancing feature requests with sprint commitments
**Solution**: Implemented feedback backlog and daily priority reviews
**Outcome**: Delivered core features while incorporating valuable feedback
